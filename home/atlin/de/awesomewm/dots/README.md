# AwesomeWM

This is my old awesomewm config! It was very enjoyable but I no longer use this configuration; it was a bit of a mess even when I was using it, I have moved it around here and there while transitioning to NixOS, and have no idea if it even works anymore. It is best to consider this deprecated; I will likely remove it after becoming more comfortable with my setup on Wayland.
